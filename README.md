##### User Story:

User - Potential Customers/Clients

How to get in touch?;

User - Business Owner:

I want to be able to provide the following:

Be able to give potential customers a basic overview of what services are provided.
Answer as many questions as possible.
Provide feedback from current clients to encourage contact.
Make contacting as simple as possible (Contact forma and alternate methods of contact)



### Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

##### Existing Features
Feature 1 - Nav Bar
Nav Bar allows simple and efficient navigation to desired area of the web page. On clicking required area, page scrolls to related area on the web page.

Feature 2 - Contact form
Contact Form - simply requires name and email address. Type field of "email" ensures valid email address is entered. Using the emailJS site/email templates. The forms submits to my personal email address. Within the emailJS template I have configured an automated response that would in real life provide a free guide.

Feature 3 - Footer
Footer links to the National 3 Peaks website for in depth information/event organisation.

Feature 4 - Google Map 

Google Map API integrated into web page. Markers added to show the location of the three peaks. Unable to figure out how to implement information windows. Also everytime moved the code to a seperate JS file, the map would not show.


##### Features Left to Implement
Better use of the Google Maps API to show more information on the locations.
